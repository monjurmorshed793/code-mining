For example, if you want to meet elastic demands, you need your instances to be relatively independent.  If they have a common, lengthy bottleneck, you won’t reap benefit from multiple instances.   The quandary is that avoiding the synchronization (bottleneck) often lowers the per-instance performance.

Moreover, the JWT token have to be stored anyway, so better place it into a single entry point to avoid data replication (horinzontal scalability can still be done for the gateway if the need appear). To prevent cookie/session information to be stolen, then I can compare the DB version to the one which is stored into the Web Browser.
The annoying effect, is that µServices will generate a lot of HTTP traffic between each others, and it does not seems to be the ""good"" way of organizing these.","2017-01-13 16:12:01","","3241889","CC BY-SA 3.0","41618538"

If there is a team that is responsible for a microservice, you give that team the task that will change it, even if it's DB migration. If there are two microservices, there should be two tasks for two teams. Your feature isn't decomposed to tasks enough if you have troubles with giving a task to other team.","2020-06-19 14:34:17","","2152061","CC BY-SA 4.0","62445523"

The problem is we use blue ocean for configuring jobs in Jenkins which allows multibranhc pipeline with automated triggers etc. We do use scripted Jenkinsfile for all the jobs. The problem is with blueocean the job configuration doesn't give the option for ""Polling ignores commits in certain paths"" under Additional Behaviours. What;s the best way to have such a job configured with automated triggers that trigger builds only based on changes in specific folders in Github.","2019-03-11 13:34:51","","5953419","CC BY-SA 4.0","55073537"

The nodejs server (the servers where all clients are connected to, acting as a proxy) sends the message only to the clients authenticated with that user ID. If the user ID is `null` then the message is broadcasted. When a message needs to be sent to multiple users then the message is multiplied. I use web clients (HTML/JS), a PHP backend and nodejs as Server Sent Endpoint.","2017-11-14 06:22:38","","2575224","CC BY-SA 3.0","47276560"

To remove concurrency, you need to redesign both your data model and business logic so that you don't actually update the data, but rather append to it only.

Every request you get should do to your API gateway, and the gateway will then further it to the microservice.

So you get your request in you API GW, it calls the different microservices ( async if the data from the different services don't interact with each other), and then combines them in the response and sends it back. example: https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Richardson-microservices-part2-3_api-gateway.png","2017-08-07 11:06:25","","6400278","CC BY-SA 3.0","45544777"

Combining several small microservices based views into a usable app introduces other 'problems', testing and integration wise. My JSF app always used (micro) services, either local or remote. Maybe your application does too much but that is not caused by JSF but by the general architecture.  A good deploy mechanism where you can do this rolling prevents downtime in general. We do this all the time when just updating some 'small' service and have no problems.","2019-09-15 18:07:15","","4478047","CC BY-SA 4.0","57943847"

- Local Discovery Server is totally optional
- Security in OPC UA is optional
- Speed may be difficult, but I also depends a bit on the implementation.The upcoming UDP transport protocol would enable a bit faster rates as well
- Get a good quality OPC UA SDK with proper support; It may cost you a bit more, but saves you a lot.","2018-12-20 15:54:18","","1282835","CC BY-SA 4.0","53869629"

If only one server goes down, everything goes down. There is no reason to compare anything else — only cases when everything is completely broken and down do matter. And in case of monolithic architecture you have only one server, but in case of microservices — several. Chances that all servers in microservice architecture will go down are less than such chances for only one monolithic server.

An alternative would be to create a public DNS Zone and let it be managed by [external-dns](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/external-dns). This way you can give services annotations which are picked up by external-dns, which will then create DNS records in the managed zone containing the private IPs (so it's only partly public).

If you're just going to expose data objects, I think you'll end up with anaemic services and you're going to have your actual business logic somewhere else. One of the advantages of microservices is the flexibility you get and a lot of people I've talked to utilize that and make their services fit the task at hand much better than a 'one size fits all' approach.","2018-06-11 05:59:17","","3924803","CC BY-SA 4.0","50790960"

For the purchase screen the purchase service and users service should be called to get the data for the screen. Alternatively a separate api could be put in front of the services  which will call both services and then return the data back to the screen. 

Take a look at the diagram [here](http://martinfowler.com/articles/microservices.html#DecentralizedDataManagement) which shows how it should work.","2015-05-28 13:27:10","","2326610","CC BY-SA 3.0","29460485"

If you have say 20 hops and each hop takes 5 ms on network its 100ms of just hopping, but if you service takes 1000 ms to do actual work, then shaving of these 10ms will not be worth it, rather you need to look into y 1000 ms at servicce layer.

"86908065","49944789","1","Your EventStore should have *only* these columns: `event_id, invoice_id, event_type, event_payload`. You remove the `payment`, `adjustment` and the `status` columns. The event properties are serialized in the `event_payload` column in a format that suits you (i.e. json). So, when a command arrives to your Invoice, you load all the events, you deserialize them and you apply them to the Invoice entity. The Invoice builds its internal state (the `total_amount` and the `status`) and then process the command. So, the state is not maintainted in the EventStore but in memory.","2018-04-20 16:14:56","","2575224","CC BY-SA 3.0","49944789"

To get Spring Boot 2.0 support, you need Spring Cloud Finchley & SCS 2.0.  At the time of writing, Finchley is still only RC and SCS just had a first milestone.  You can use these, but they're not GA so you get what you get.  My suggestion, would be at least to try your demo app with SB 1.5 & SCS 1.5 to see if it works.  That would give you a sanity check that you're configuring things correctly and help to rule out problems with pre-release code.

You commit the transaction locally and emit the event on message broker. The event will be consumed by other services. If there is any problem you need to raise compensated transaction/Event. You also save the events locally before publishing them call outbox pattern.

That avoids the ""spreading too thin"" problem (for example: splitting a Forums Service in to ""Forum Threads Service"", ""New Post Service"", ""Search Forum Service"", etc.) Some services will have to be shared, for example your Authentication/Authorization service. After all the features are set up, our FrontEnd people build a UI around all the APIs and that is our ""Front End Service"". So now if the ""ForumsService"" or ""ArticlesService"" go down, the FE still works fine, just missing Features.

I just dont see that many companies are using ES and CQRS in its true form, as opposed to rpc.

When this question is made available, container orchestration was still relatively in its early days but today, we can see the recommended strategies. You can for example, deploy multiple microservices into a single VM but they should vary by type and not be completely representative of your entire application for resiliency and availability purposes. One container per VM would be overkill and in some ways take away advantages of containers.","2020-07-08 00:42:48","","1376205","CC BY-SA 4.0","52715200"
