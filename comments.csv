For example, if you want to meet elastic demands, you need your instances to be relatively independent.  If they have a common, lengthy bottleneck, you wonât reap benefit from multiple instances.   The quandary is that avoiding the synchronization (bottleneck) often lowers the per-instance performance.

Moreover, the JWT token have to be stored anyway, so better place it into a single entry point to avoid data replication (horinzontal scalability can still be done for the gateway if the need appear).

The annoying effect, is that ÂµServices will generate a lot of HTTP traffic between each others, and it does not seems to be the ""good"" way of organizing these.","2017-01-13 16:12:01","","3241889","CC BY-SA 3.0","41618538"

The first approach is the correct one, in terms of safest deployment. If there is a team that is responsible for a microservice, you give that team the task that will change it, even if it's DB migration. If there are two microservices, there should be two tasks for two teams. Your feature isn't decomposed to tasks enough if you have troubles with giving a task to other team.","2020-06-19 14:34:17","","2152061","CC BY-SA 4.0","62445523"

If the user ID is `null` then the message is broadcasted. When a message needs to be sent to multiple users then the message is multiplied.

To remove concurrency, you need to redesign both your data model and business logic so that you don't actually update the data, but rather append to it only. Append-only data models are concurrency friendly - meaning they don't block, but you'd likely need to redesign the logic that reads from the datamodel.","2015-03-10 04:20:45","","151350","CC BY-SA 3.0","28930710"

Every request you get should do to your API gateway, and the gateway will then further it to the microservice.

So you get your request in you API GW, it calls the different microservices ( async if the data from the different services don't interact with each other), and then combines them in the response and sends it back. example: https://cdn.wp.nginx.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Richardson-microservices-part2-3_api-gateway.png","2017-08-07 11:06:25","","6400278","CC BY-SA 3.0","45544777"

- Local Discovery Server is totally optional
- Security in OPC UA is optional
- Speed may be difficult, but I also depends a bit on the implementation.The upcoming UDP transport protocol would enable a bit faster rates as well
- Get a good quality OPC UA SDK with proper support; It may cost you a bit more, but saves you a lot.","2018-12-20 15:54:18","","1282835","CC BY-SA 4.0","53869629"

Part of refactoring is recognizing new objects and functions and pulling them out into separate packages.

So, when a command arrives to your Invoice, you load all the events, you deserialize them and you apply them to the Invoice entity.

You can use these, but they're not GA so you get what you get.  My suggestion, would be at least to try your demo app with SB 1.5 & SCS 1.5 to see if it works.  That would give you a sanity check that you're configuring things correctly and help to rule out problems with pre-release code.

Inside the container gives you some benefits such as being not having to install package dependencies for the tests in your local environment and it could be well isolated for various environments so I don't see why not if thats your main question.

You could put such events in your GraphQL schema, and maybe use [federation](https://www.apollographql.com/blog/apollo-federation-f260cf525d21) to partition your domain into bounded contexts and unify those contexts in a single endpoint. Then the notifications can be created either by the server, or as a side-effect of a mutation. But again, care must be taken not to shoehorn an improper solution.

Maybe it will be even better for understanding to put it that way.

So let's say in that one large application you identify that Operation A is a bottleneck and takes up most of the CPU time.  Scaling out that entire application just for that one operation is wasteful.  If Operation A is itself a small application instance, you can scale out just that one application.  Put it behind a load balancer with a single endpoint, point the rest of the system to that endpoint, and you've more cheaply and easily addressed the problem.","2017-07-07 18:23:29","","328193","CC BY-SA 3.0","44977364"

That avoids the ""spreading too thin"" problem (for example: splitting a Forums Service in to ""Forum Threads Service"", ""New Post Service"", ""Search Forum Service"", etc.) Some services will have to be shared, for example your Authentication/Authorization service. After all the features are set up, our FrontEnd people build a UI around all the APIs and that is our ""Front End Service"".

You need to iterate over the result of `getRegisteredServices` as it's an array of endpoint urls. In each iteration you call `getInfo`.

Then you need to store each result of `getInfo` in your component as a property. This should probably be an array of objects.

In your template you can then iterate over this array of objects using `*ngFor` and display the object values.","2020-07-30 10:44:27","","2352314","CC BY-SA 4.0","63171135"

Further, why would you serve your service on a non-default port? What possible gain do you plan to make by it, other than confusing apps that want to consume your service because you decided to change the port. I don't get it.","2020-09-28 04:57:55","","5338888","CC BY-SA 4.0","64095860"

So Services are accessible within the cluster and each service is essentially pointing to containers.

I can create a package with `npm pack` and can install that package in other projects, but then I have my source code inside the node_modules folder. I try to find a quick solution how to make the functionalities such as configs, custom commands etc. directly reusable. Therefore I will need an entry point, such as an index.js or?","2020-10-13 08:45:37","","4062803","CC BY-SA 4.0","64316393"

I have updated the details to include the structure of my event store as I use a single 'Commits' collection for all my events and the streamId property is the partition key that in my example is the UserId guid. What would be the benefit of having separate collections with the UserId as the partition key for each one?","2020-10-14 10:13:58","","1180223","CC BY-SA 4.0","64350368"

```@Override

The question is, can I somehow pass it to @Configuration class?","2020-10-15 15:00:45","","14004705","CC BY-SA 4.0","64358590"
