       "      <td>&lt;p&gt;I've been very interested in trying out microservices/SOA as an architecture and am having a hard time conceptualizing how the integration between services would actually be done.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I like the idea of using messaging to decouple the clients from the services, but don't understand how a system could utilize it exclusively. The typical async operations and pub/sub stuff obviously makes sense - scenarios like creating a new order, broadcasting data for reporting, etc. What I don't understand is whether people typically try to use messaging for common request/reply scenarios - for example, a user hits their \"profile\" page and part of the data that needs to get rendered on the page is from a user service.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I know common messaging implementations provide REST-like reply/request functionality but is that often used for simple data requests? It seems more likely that microservices would both expose REST endpoints and also register with a message broker for different types of communication it will participate in, but all these presentations I watch of SOA and microservice architecture seem to suggest they only use one or the other..&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;Thanks for any elaboration/experiences!&lt;/p&gt;\\n</td>\n",

I want the user to authenticate once and have access to all the different services and applications.&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I can think of several approaches:&lt;/p&gt;\\n\\n&lt;ol&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Add Identity service and application. Any service that has protected resources will talk to the Identity service to make sure the credentials it has are valid. If they are not it will redirect the user for authentication.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Use a web-standard such as OpenID and have each service handle it own identities. This means the user will have to authorize individually each service/application but after that it will be SSO.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;\\n&lt;/ol&gt;\\n\\n&lt;p&gt;I'll be happy to hear other ideas.

        <p>I've been very interested in trying out microservices/SOA as an architecture and am having a hard time conceptualizing how the integration between services would actually be done.</p>\\n\\n<p>I like the idea of using messaging to decouple the clients from the services, but don't understand how a system could utilize it exclusively. The typical async operations and pub/sub stuff obviously makes sense - scenarios like creating a new order, broadcasting data for reporting, etc. What I don't understand is whether people typically try to use messaging for common request/reply scenarios - for example, a user hits their \"profile\" page and part of the data that needs to get rendered on the page is from a user service.</p>\\n\\n<p>I know common messaging implementations provide REST-like reply/request functionality but is that often used for simple data requests? It seems more likely that microservices would both expose REST endpoints and also register with a message broker for different types of communication it will participate in, but all these presentations I watch of SOA and microservice architecture seem to suggest they only use one or the other..</p>\\n\\n<p>Thanks for any elaboration/experiences!</p>\\n   \n",

 solution to this.

have a spring boot application that uses the <strong>actuator, auto-configuration and JPA</strong>. I want to be able to use an in-memory DB in my <strong>test</strong> profile, a MySQL DB configuration during <strong>development</strong> and a separate <strong>production</strong> DB configuration when the app is deployed in production. Presumably from the java command line I should be able to specify the environment and the right configuration file or config block in <strong>application.properties</strong> (or .yml) will be picked up.</p>\\n\\n<p>I have not found a good post with example describing how to do this switching so I thought I'd ask if anyone has a good example. My main aim is to pre-define the <code>spring.datasource</code> and <code>spring.jpa</code> properties at build time and then at run-time switch the app config per environment \"dynamically\" using the java command line argument. Secondary goal would be to do the same with the <code>management</code> configurations, etc.</p>\\n\\n<p>Thank you.</p>\\n   \n",

                    <p>I'm trying to design a green-field project that will have several services (serving data) and web-applications (serving HTML). I've read about microservices and they look like good fit.</p>\\n\\n<p>The problem I still have is how to implement SSO. I want the user to authenticate once and have access to all the different services and applications.</p>\\n\\n<p>I can think of several approaches:</p>\\n\\n<ol>\\n<li><p>Add Identity service and application. Any service that has protected resources will talk to the Identity service to make sure the credentials it has are valid. If they are not it will redirect the user for authentication.</p></li>\\n<li><p>Use a web-standard such as OpenID and have each service handle it own identities. This means the user will have to authorize individually each service/application but after that it will be SSO.</p></li>\\n</ol>\\n\\n<p>I'll be happy to hear other ideas. If a specific PaaS (such as Heroku) has a proprietary solution that would also be acceptable.</p>\\n   \n",

Apps</strong> in Spring Boot.\\nEach Web App must be independent, with the exception that I would like to <strong>centralize the login</strong> management and keep Users connected through every Apps.</p>\\n<p><strong>Example :</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>App1 : Must be public</li>\\n<li>App2 : User must be authenticated</li>\\n<li>App3 : User must be authenticated</li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>I would like If a user goes to the App2, the website ask him to login. If he goes after that to the App3, I don't want the website asks him to login again.</p>\\n<p>My first idea was to share Login Sessions between micro-services, but I have read that it' not a good way. Create a <strong>Gateway</strong> seems the best practice.</p>\\n<p><strong>So I tried to use these dependencies :</strong></p>\\n<ul>\\n<li>For URL redirection : <strong>Spring Cloud</strong></li>\\n<li>For User authentication : <strong>Spring Security</strong></li>\\n</ul>\\n<p>Spring Security seems not compatible with Spring Cloud so I haven't figured out how to <strong>redirect requests</strong> and to <strong>check user authentication</strong> at the same time.</p>\\n<p>If anybody could help me please or has an easy sample to show me, I would be grateful :)</p>\\n<p>Thanks</p>\\n   \n",
